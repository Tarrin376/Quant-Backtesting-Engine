## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Backtesting Engine setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Tarrin376/Quant-Backtesting-Engine.git && cd Quant-Backtesting-Engine
```

#### 2. Create a build directory and move to it
```bash
> mkdir build
> cd build
```

#### 3. Build executable with CMake (the executable will be generated in the /bin directory)
```bash
> cmake ..
> cmake --build .
```

#### 4. Run the backtesting-engine executable
```bash
> cd ../bin
> ./backtesting-engine.exe
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
===== Backtest Statistics =====
Initial Capital     : $10000.00
Final Capital       : $10000.00
Final Profit/Loss   : $0.00
Percentage Return   : 0.00%
Number of Trades    : 0
Win Rate            : 0.00%
Winning Positions   : 0
Losing Positions    : 0
===============================

Dataset size: 0
Strategy used: Bollinger Band Mean Reversion
```

This is expected, as we haven't specified any backtesting data file to use in the /data directory.

### Python environment setup and running scripts

#### 1. Move to the `python_scripts` directory
```bash
> cd ../python_scripts
```

#### 2. Create virtual environment and activate it (optional)
```bash
> virtualenv venv
> ./venv/Scripts/activate
```

#### 3. Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt` file
```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Create a /data directory in the project root directory
```bash
> cd ..
> mkdir data
```

#### 5a. Generate historical data that will be consumed by the Backtesting Engine
```bash
> cd python_scripts
> python market_data_fetcher.py
```

#### 5b. Customise the historical data fetched from the Alpaca Markets API

Once you run the `market_data_fetcher.py` script, you will get the following output:

```bash
usage: market_data_fetcher.py [-h] [-s START] [-e END] [-sym SYMBOL] [-tf TIMEFRAME]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s START, --start START
                        start date for historical data in YYYY-MM-DD (default: 2022-01-01)
  -e END, --end END     end date for historical data in YYYY-MM-DD (default: 2022-01-30)
  -sym SYMBOL, --symbol SYMBOL
                        Crypto symbol to fetch historical data for e.g. BTC or ETH (default: BTC)
  -tf TIMEFRAME, --timeframe TIMEFRAME
                        The frequency of the OHLC data e.g. [1-59]Min, [1-23]Hour, [number]Day, [number]Week, [1-12]Month (default: 1Min)
```

These are flags that you can include when running the `market_data_fetcher.py` script to change what historical data is fetched.
For example:
```bash
python market_data_fetcher.py -s 2023-01-01 -e 2024-01-01 -sym ETH -tf 1Hour`
```

This will generate a file containing 1 hour OHLCV data from 2023-01-01 to 2024-01-01 for Ethereum.

### Using historical data in the Backtesting Engine

#### 1. Check that you have historical data ready to use

If you generated a historical data file using the `market_data_fetcher.py` script, you should see a new file in the /data directory.
However, if you are planning on using your own historical data, please ensure that it uses the CSV file format and follows the below structure:
```
Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,Timestamp
```

#### 2. Provide the file name as a flag to the backtesting-engine executable
```bash
> cd ../bin
> ./backtesting-engine [-f | --filename] <ENTER FILE NAME HERE>
```

Additional flags can be provided to customise your backtest:
```
-> [--commission | -c] <ENTER COMMISSION APPLIED TO EACH TRADE>
-> [--balance | -b] <ENTER INITIAL CAPITAL HERE>
-> [--period | -p] <ENTER LOOKBACK PERIOD HERE (used for indicator windows e.g. SMA)
-> [--allocation | -a] <ENTER ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE AT MOST FROM THE MARKET AND YOUR PORTFOLIO FOR A SINGLE TRADE>
-> [--strategy | -s] <ENTER THE STRATEGY THAT YOU WANT TO USE>
      - Strategies available (to be extended):
        - `ma-price-cross`: Moving Average Price Crossover Strategy
        - `bb-mean-rev`: Bollinger Band Mean Reversion Strategy (default)
        - `stochastic-osc-cross`: Stochastic Oscillator Crossover Strategy
```
